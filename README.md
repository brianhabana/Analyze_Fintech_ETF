## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

* [hvlpot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.

* [SqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

* [Viola](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/blob/stable/docs/source/index.rst) - Voil√† allows you to convert a Jupyter Notebook into an interactive dashboard that allows you to share your work with others. It is secure and customizable, giving you control over what your readers experience.
